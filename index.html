        <h1>Batman: The Dark Night</h1>
        <img src="images/BatmanCC.jpeg" alt="Batman from the waist up, with head tilted down, in black and white">
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman" target="_blank">Batman</a> was born Bruce Wayne, to Dr. Thomas and Martha Wayne of Gotham City. As a child, he witnessed the murder of his parents, which led him to devote his life to training as a vigilante crime-fighter. He studied chemistry, martial arts, mechanics, boxing, psychology, and perfected his skills in all realms. By day he averts suspicion by playing the part of Bruce Wayne, careless playboy and millionaire owner of Wayne Enterprises. Though he feigns drunkenness, he is an avowed teetotaler, wholly committed to maintaining his physical and mental prowess.</p>

        <p>Batman is faced with a rogues gallery of villains, including</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Joker</li>
                <li>The Riddler</li>
                <li>Catwoman</li>
                <li>The Penguin</li>
                <li>and Mr. Freeze.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>They are bent on chaos and crime, but none of them are a match for the Batman.</p>
